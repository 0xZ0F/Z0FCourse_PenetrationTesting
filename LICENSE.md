To become "permitted for teaching", you must support me on Patreon with a $15 USD or higher tier. You are only permitted for teaching while your Patreon subscription is active.  
  
The course I am providing is "Z0FCourse".

You are free to download the course for personal use only.   

You cannot use my course for your own teaching unless you are permitted for teaching. If you are permitted for teaching you can redistribute the course to only the students you are teaching, otherwise, you cannot redistribute the course to anyone for any reason.  
The redistribution of a modified version of my course follows the same rules as previously mentioned.
