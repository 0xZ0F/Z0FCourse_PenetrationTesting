# Overview
Until we get to binary exploitation, this course will be using 64 bit systems. Even when we do get to binary exploitation, we will be using 32 bit and 64 bit. 

### It's very important to note that Linux is not backwards compatible like Windows. You cannot run a 32 bit program on a 64 bit Linux, or vise versa, like you can on Windows.
