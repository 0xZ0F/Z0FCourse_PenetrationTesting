# How To Follow This Course
Any folders or files with a name surrounded with square brackets, such as "[ignore]", are not important. It's usually something like the images used in the course.

If there are multiple parts to one section, they will be in numerical order if necessary. Any important information will be in files with the "@" prefix.

I use some technical lingo and abbreviations. If you don't know what they mean or forget what they mean, go to [Lingo.md](Lingo.md).
