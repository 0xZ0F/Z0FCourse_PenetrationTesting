What I plan on teaching. These are inevitable. This IS DIFFERENT than TODO which is what I'm currently working on or towards.


## What each step of the path is:  

**Passive Reconnaissance** - What can you find just on Google (or Bing, Yahoo, etc).

**Active Reconnaissance** - Scanning a system for open ports, what's running on those ports, etc.

**Identifying Vulnerabilities** - After reconnaissance it's time to look for potential security holes.

**Exploiting Vulnerabilities** - Exploit the vulnerabilities found.

**Post-Exploitation** - After the system has been exploited, it's time to plant a back door, hide, and get as much information and loot as possible.

**Covering Tracks** - Once in the system, you don't want to be caught. We need to find logs and modify them, or at least delete them, so we can stay hidden.


## What the path includes:
**Passive Reconnaissance** - Using search engines to our advantage. Primarily Google. Looking at job postings, company websites, and more.

**Active Reconnaissance** - Using NMap, Wireshark, Dirbuster, SQLMap, and more.

**Identifying Vulnerabilities** - Using information gathered previously to look for known vulnerabilities on ExploitDB, CVE, and more. We will be using our brain and some creativity as well.

**Exploiting Vulnerabilities** - Using exploits found online and creating our own to take advantage of the vulnerabilities we found.

**Post-Exploitation** - Planting hidden back doors, staying hidden, finding useful information to further aid the post-exploitation, and more.

**Covering Tracks** - Modifying logs and clearing/deleting logs if necessary. Reducing memory and disk usage, obfuscating exploits, and more.
