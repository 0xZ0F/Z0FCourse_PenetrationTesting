<br />I can't provide a download for all things such as a Windows ISO for legal reasons.

## Prerequisites
### Required:
* Knowledge about A+ content - You don't need the certification, just the knowledge.
* Knowledge about Network+ content - You don't need the certification, just the knowledge.
* Knowledge about Security+ content - You don't need the certification, just the knowledge.
* Using Linux
<br />To learn A+, Network+, and Security+, I recommend [Professor Messer on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/professormesser). Go to his channel and look for the courses in his playlists. A direct link to the playlists are provided below, however, they may not be the latest versions.

<br /><br />You can, of course, learn from wherever you want. 
<br />That's a lot to take in, I know. Trust me when I say it will be worth it. It may be boring, it was for me, but you're better off learning it now rather than figure out you need to learn it when you're already in three months.

### Preferred:
* Python 2 and/or 3, they are similar enough that it doesn't really matter. I would recommend learning Python3 because it's newer. You should know however that most Linux distributions come with Python2 installed by default.
* Bash Scripting - This should be pretty easy if you know the Linux command line. Bash scripting is just Linux commands in a file that can be run.
<br /><br />Learn Python (This course is a bit overkill, but that's okay. Feel free to skip the Django stuff):
