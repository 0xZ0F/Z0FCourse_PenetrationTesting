# Z0FCourse - WIP
Offensive computer security course by Z0F.

## Resouces Needed:
* Ability to run up to 2 VMs at the same time. Preferably VirtualBox.
* Kali Linux, ParrotSec, or similar.

## Prerequisites
### Required:
* Knowledge about A+ content - You don't need the certification, just the knowledge.
* Knowledge about Network+ content - You don't need the certification, just the knowledge.
* Knowledge about Security+ content - You don't need the certification, just the knowledge.
* Using Linux
To learn A+, Network+, and Security+, I recommend [Professor Messer on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/professormesser). Go to his channel and look for the courses in his playlists. A direct link to the playlists are provided below, however, they may not be the latest versions.

[Network+ Course]
[Security+ Course]

### Prefered:
* Python 2 and/or 3, they are similar enough that it doesn't really matter. I would recommend learning Python3 because it's newer. You should know however that most Linux distributions come with Python2 installed by default.
* Bash Scripting - This should be pretty easy if you know the Linux command line. Bash scripting is just Linux commands in a file that can be run.
