## Prerequisites
* ### Required:
    * Knowledge about A+ content - You don't need the certification, just the knowledge.
    * Knowledge about Network+ content - You don't need the certification, just the knowledge.
    * Knowledge about Security+ content - You don't need the certification, just the knowledge.
    * Using Linux
<br /><br />To learn A+, Network+, and Security+, I recommend [Professor Messer on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/user/professormesser). Go to his channel and look for the courses in his playlists. A direct link to the playlists are provided below, however, they may not be the latest versions.

<br /><br />You can, of course, learn from wherever you want. 
<br />That's a lot to take in, I know. Trust me when I say it will be worth it. It may be boring, it was for me, but you're better off learning it now rather than figure out you need to learn it when you're already in three months.

* ### Preferred:
    * Python 2 and/or 3, they are similar enough that it doesn't really matter. I would recommend learning Python3 because it's newer. You should know however that most Linux distributions come with Python2 installed as the primary version.
    * Bash Scripting - This should be pretty easy if you know the Linux command line. Bash scripting is just Linux commands in a file that can be run.
<br /><br />**Learn Python** (This course is a bit overkill, but that's okay. Feel free to skip the Django stuff):

## Important Notes:
THIS COURSE IS A WORK IN PROGRESS! I'm no where near done, but feel free to watch the course develop over time! If you have any feedback or suggestions let me know on Twitter! If you would like to know a little of what I have planned, see the content inside of the [DOC](DOC) folder.

I use some technical lingo and abbreviations. If you forget what they mean, or don't know what they mean, go to [Lingo.md](Lingo.md).

The course folders are organized in a specific way. Any folders or files with a name surrounded with square brackets, such as "[ignore]", are not important. It's usually something like the images used in the course.
